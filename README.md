# Random-User-Generator

This is a fun little Vue app built following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs) to learn about the basic functionality of the framework. One way to extend it would be to make a fun search feature where users can search the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) by gender, age, etc.
